    "newton_first_law_dlg_1": "A net external force is the sum of all forces acting on the object. If the net external force is zero, then there is no acceleration.",
    "newton_first_law_dlg_1_2": "I will now drop a large object from the sky to demonstrate.",
    "newton_first_law_dlg_2": "There are two forces currently acting on this object: gravity and normal force.",
    "newton_first_law_dlg_3": "The gravity force is pulling the object towards Earth, which allows it to fall in the first place.",
    "newton_first_law_dlg_3_2": "The normal force is pushing the object outwards from the surface.",
    "newton_first_law_dlg_4": "Adding both the gravity and normal force will result in zero net force. Thus, the object is at rest.",
    "newton_first_law_dlg_5": "It looks like the princess has been taken hostage by these nefarious goblins!",
    "newton_first_law_dlg_6": "Let us summon our mighty knights for a daring rescue!",
    "newton_first_law_inertia_dlg_1": "Excellent! Notice how it took a couple of knights to push the block?",
    "newton_first_law_inertia_dlg_2": "The block's mass allows its frictional force to resist the pushing force of the knights.",
    "newton_first_law_inertia_dlg_3": "Mass is a measure of inertia. The unit of measurement shown here is in kg (kilograms), which is 1000 grams per 1 kilogram.",
    "newton_first_law_inertia_dlg_4": "Inertia is the tendency of any physical object to resist any change in motion. A change in motion is acceleration due to net force acting on the object.",
    "newton_first_law_inertia_dlg_5": "I will now drop another object from the sky. This time with less mass. Just one more block to rescue our damsel in distress!",
    "newton_first_law_inertia_2_dlg_1": "In this scenario, we will learn more about how inertia influences force.",
    "newton_first_law_inertia_2_dlg_2": "Observe how the forces are interacting on this balance scale.",
    "newton_first_law_inertia_2_dlg_3": "The weight on each platform causes the scale to tip. If both platforms have equal weight, they will align horizontally.",
    "newton_first_law_inertia_2_dlg_4": "Here's a locked treasure as a demonstration. Put the correct amount of weight on the other platform to unlock it.",

    "newton_second_law_dlg_1": "Acceleration is what causes an object’s velocity to change over time. Which means the object will speed up, slow down, or change direction.",
    "newton_second_law_dlg_2": "Here are the equations for both the net force (F-net), and acceleration (A). Where mass is kilograms (kg), distance is meters (m), and time is seconds (s).",
    "newton_second_law_dlg_3": "As you can see, the more mass an object has, the less it will accelerate from the net force.",
    "newton_second_law_dlg_4": "Note that: force, acceleration, and velocity are all vectors.",
    "newton_second_law_dlg_4_2": "A vector is composed of a value for each axis. In this case, the x and y. These values can also tell us the direction, and the magnitude.",
    "newton_second_law_dlg_5": "A mighty knight has brought us a wheel to demonstrate. The wheel is enchanted with magical trails to allow us to observe its motion.",
    "newton_second_law_dlg_6": "The first few trails are where the knight was pushing the wheel. You can see that the distance between them are increasing.",
    "newton_second_law_dlg_7": "At this point, the distance between each trail is equal. This means that the net force acting on the wheel is zero.",
    "newton_second_law_dlg_8": "The trails here are going down. We can observe that the only force acting on the wheel is gravity.",
    "newton_second_law_graph_1": "The graph maps out the trails across time along the x and y axis. Be sure to check the velocity and acceleration by scrolling down.",
    "newton_second_law_graph_2": "Observe how the position line curves as velocity increases, indicating that there is acceleration.",
    "newton_second_law_graph_3": "If the position line is straight, then velocity is constant, and therefore no acceleration.",
    "newton_second_law_dlg_9": "The nefarious goblins have appeared out of thin air! They are surely up to no good. Push them off the cliff with the wheel.",
