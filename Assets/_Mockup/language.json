    "newton_first_law_dlg_kidnap_2": "Let me drop an object that will help us in this predicament. This will show us the first law in action.",
    "newton_first_law_dlg_gravity": "The gravity force is pulling the object towards Earth, which allows it to fall.",
    "newton_first_law_dlg_landed_1": "Now that the object has landed, the ground is pushing it up. This cancels out the gravity force. The object is now at rest.",
    "newton_first_law_dlg_landed_2": "Go ahead and summon a mighty knight to push the object!",

    "newton_second_law_dlg_4": "Note that: force, acceleration, and velocity are all vectors.",
    "newton_second_law_dlg_4_2": "A vector has a value for each axis. In this case, the x and y. These values can tell us the direction, and the magnitude.",
